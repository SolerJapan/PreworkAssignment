		<p>My name is Alexander Soler. I have a bachelors in Computer Science and Japanese.
			My Japanese is conversational level and even hold an N3 Certification from the JLPT. (Japanese Language Proficency Test)  
			Perhaps in the future when things are settled for me I may try for N2. My current focus 
			is improving my main craft of computer programming and securing work and building further experience.

		<p>I currently dont have a final dream goal for where i want to be as of yet.
		In the past I have had an interest in developing games but I realized that my skills can be used in various ways.
		So right now I want to develop my skills so that I can move into any position I may hold an interest in and focus 
		from there. With my interest in Japanese culture my journey may even take me there
