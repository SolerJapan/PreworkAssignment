		<p>I have many interests in my day to day life. I mainly like to train my body as it
		contributes greatly to keeping myself healthy. I also like to watch different videos and go to forums to
		gather information when there usually isnt much else for me to do. Sometimes i would learn something interesting.

		<p >I have once traveled to Japan to learn more Japanese. Not just in terms of
        the language but also the culture. There were so many unique and interesting things that were done
        in daily life in shinjuku that it was easy to get used to it. If you can get past the language barrier.	
        As well as understand the expenses.	Credit to the people who break it down in these videos.
